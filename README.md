This repository serves as a living document of my personal toolkit. It's a curated list of the software, hardware, and configurations I use daily for development, learning, and creation.

## üß† Knowledge Management

This is the core of my digital brain, designed for long-term knowledge retention and creation with a strong focus on data ownership. My system is built around two key concepts: a **Personal Library** for collecting raw information and a **Second Brain** for synthesizing it into personal knowledge.

| Role | Toolchain | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üìö **Personal Library** | **Zotero + Nextcloud** | For collecting, organizing, and annotating high-quality source materials (PDFs, web pages). |
| üß† **Second Brain** | **Trilium Notes** | For synthesizing, linking, and creating my own networked knowledge base. |

#### Workflow in a Nutshell:
My process is simple yet powerful: information flows from the outside world into my **Library (Zotero)**, where I read and digest it. Then, the distilled insights and my own thoughts are permanently forged into interconnected notes within my **Second Brain (Trilium)**.

## üíª Development Environment

My primary setup for writing code. I value simplicity, speed, and a consistent experience across different machines.

#### Core Editor & IDE
*   **Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My go-to for almost everything.
    *   **Theme**: One Dark Pro Night Flat
    *   **Font**:  Maple Mono NF
    *   **Account**: `sammiler`
*   **IDE**: [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - For heavy-duty C++ debugging and Windows development.
*   **IDE (JetBrains)**: CLion / Rider (depending on the project).
