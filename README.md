This repository serves as a living document of my personal toolkit. It's a curated list of the software, hardware, and configurations I use daily for development, learning, and creation.

## 🧠 Knowledge Management

This is the core of my digital brain, designed for long-term knowledge retention and creation with a strong focus on data ownership.

| Role | Toolchain | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📚 **Personal Library** | **Zotero + Nextcloud** | For collecting, organizing, and annotating high-quality source materials (PDFs, web pages). |
| 🧠 **Second Brain** | **Trilium Notes** | For synthesizing, linking, and creating my own networked knowledge base. |

## 💻 Development Environment

My primary setup for writing code. I value simplicity, speed, and a consistent experience across different machines.

#### Core Editor & IDE
*   **Editor**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My go-to for almost everything.
    *   **Theme**: One Dark Pro
    *   **Font**: Fira Code (with ligatures)
    *   **Key Extensions**: `C/C++ Extension Pack`, `CMake Tools`, `GitLens`, `Prettier`.
*   **IDE**: [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - For heavy-duty C++ debugging and Windows development.
*   **IDE (JetBrains)**: CLion / Rider (depending on the project).
